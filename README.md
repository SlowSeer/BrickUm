Brick'Um
=======

A simple brick break / breakout game with a few different game-play modes.

- Campaign Mode: Play through a few campaigns with different brick shapes and layouts.
- Free Play: Play in a level where blocks re-spawn and the ball gets faster and faster the longer you survive.
- Kid Mode: An easier version of Campaign Mode. The ball is a little slower and the player cant lose.
